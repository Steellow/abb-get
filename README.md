# abb_get

I started programming abb-get in order to learn Python and web scraping. Will develop when I have time, it's not going to be usable for a while. Inspired by [pirate-get](https://github.com/vikstrous/pirate-get).

## TODO

- [x] Print books from all search pages, not just the first one
- [ ] URL encoder
- [ ] Ability to search what you want
- [ ] Magnet link generator
- [ ] Copy magnet link / open with x program
- [ ] Print books on multiple pages instead of one big list
- [ ] Make CLI more readable
- [ ] Print torrent seeders/leechers
- [ ] Ability to sort search results (with json?)

These are not in any particular order, just some quickly thought out of my head
