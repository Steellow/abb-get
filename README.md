# abb_get

I started programming abb-get in order to learn Python and web scraping. Currently working, but full of bugs. I'm not currently using this actively so might take some time before I make it more stable.

Inspired by [pirate-get](https://github.com/vikstrous/pirate-get).

## TODO

- [x] Print books from all search pages, not just the first one
- [x] Ability to search what you want
- [x] Magnet link generator
- [ ] Copy magnet link / open with x program
- [x] Print books on multiple pages instead of one big list
- [ ] Make CLI more readable
- [ ] Print torrent seeders/leechers
- [ ] Ability to sort search results (with json?)

These are not in any particular order, just some quickly thought out of my head
